Compiling it.

ATM there is no maven build (yet), and I'm not sure whether it's allowed to bundle android
APIs to compile against. Just add android sdk to classpath.  ( take it from your sdk )

jmockit is used to perform unit tests, as everything in android sdk is just a stub
and will raise runtime exception. ( take care that jmockit is on classpath well before
junit - this is important )

 ATM there is only idea build as I do not use eclipse. contributions welcome
