JSON Serializer is small and lightweight library to marshall
POJOs to JSON strings intended to use in android applications.

Core features:
  - small and lightweight
  - no external dependecies (from android point of view)
  - no metadata (use reflection)
  - simple to use

Current state:
  - marshalls complete POJO trees
  - understands arrays og POJO and primitives (even multidimensional)
  - unmarshalls POJO trees,  with arrays of POJOS or primitives 
  - no collection support yet due to lack of idea  how to determine 
    object type from  JSON
  - maven artifact deployed to my private reposotory at: http://www.pribluda.de/m2/
